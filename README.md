# Hackathon2018Project
Hackathon 2018 Project: Baruch College CIS Major Assistance Program
This is a project I did in the CUNY hackathon for Spring of 2018.
The project idea was to make some sort of a program that would help 
students select classes from the list of what is "required" and the "electives" classes.
Worked on this with a couple of other CUNY students who helped with testing the code for bugs.
There are some issues I'm still trying to fix, in which some classes could count for another class. 
The code was not made to handle this exception.

Possible plans for future:
-fix the bugs and little kinks here and there. (possibly using a database + python setup)
-front end use interface using something like django.
